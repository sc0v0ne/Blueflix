# Blueflix  Streamlit

When I was in college I had developed a project with jupyter notebook, which consumes data from the [Netflix Prime Video Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) set. The idea was to use this set of data, clean, analyze and develop a stage where I could recommend movies and TV shows.

I was very happy with the result. But I wanted more, I wanted to take this notebook and transfer it to an application where I could interact with the project. So create a personal project where I can use what I studied and learned over time.

But something was missing, which was how am I going to show this result of my project. During that time I discovered this tool [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), ohhhhhhhhhh!!!!! Incredible !!! The flexibility I gained using it was very good and in addition to being able to deploy using their platform, this way I can show what I did.

I want to thank **Kaggle - @shivamb**, for making the sets below available. In addition to the Netflix set, there are 3 more.

- [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- [Hulu Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/hulu-movies-and-tv-shows)
- [Disney+ Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/disney-movies-and-tv-shows)
- [Amazon Prime Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows)

From these 4 sets, the idea of creating a single one came up to be able to expand the data further, to be able to create more recommendations. Follow the link below.

[4 Services Streaming Movies and Tv Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sc0v1n0/4-services-streaming-movies-and-tv)

If you want to understand the process more, I have a post and 4 more notebooks where I explain the notebook I created.

## Conclusion

This personal project is a dream that I am developing, I want to evolve it further with the skills I acquire along the way. I won't always be adding updates, because I have ideas of other projects that I want to evolve, but I won't stop paying attention. I hope that other developers understand my codes and that I can transfer what I learned in this time. I hope you enjoyed it. Please, if you could leave a like on my post or on my notebooks, I would really appreciate it, so I can know if you liked it. Thank you for reading this far.
